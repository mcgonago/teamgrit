## What is GRIT?

GRIT stands for "Great rides for Intense Training"

There is a Club GRIT - a group of cyclists that ride on their
indoor trainers and train using the Zwift indoor training platform.

Each week GRIT sponsers 4-5 rides, and a brand new Run on Wednesday, where  
riders get to challenge themselves across a variety of cycling disciplines  
(hills, lap racing, sprints, ...) and against other riders - at, below, or above  
their current cycling fitness.  

### Rides

Each week GRIT runs a series of rides on the Zwift platform.

GRIT also keeps track of results as part of its **weekly** `GRIT Points Race` series

The `GRIT Points Race` takes results from the **Tuesday (KOM hunt)**, **Thursday (Sprints)**,
and **Friday (Mountain Route)**. Monday and Wednesday are more of a `chill group ride`.

Typically:

- Monday    - Group Ride - mostly chill, could turn into PartyTime
- Tuesday   - All American Bikes Ride - KOM hunt   **GRIT Points**
- Wednesday - Group Ride - again, mostly chill - some may go for a KOM
- Wednesday - Run
- Thursday  - Tempo(ish) Thursday - SPRINTS!!!   **GRIT Points**
- Friday    - Group Ride - Mountain Route   **GRIT Points**
