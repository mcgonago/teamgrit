Reminding word from Zwift - and I quote *"For as long as one's privacy is not
violated, you can go ahead with your idea"*

Semi-official link is [**Sharing results with friends**](https://forums.zwift.com/t/sharing-results-with-friends/534276/8 "Sharing with friends at Zwift forum")

Will update blog if/when that changes.

Moral of today's story?

**`The good`**
- **AB** kept us all safe out there
- **MGCC** hosting a great ride
- **GRITers** lighting it up out there
- `Squanchy`, `30% better than Bjarne`, and `mOb1u5` taking names


**`The bad`**
- `How can there be anything bad riding a bike?`

**`The ugly`**
- What is ugly to one, is beautiful to another
- `Titan Grove` and `Titan Reverse` getting name in lights


**Titan Forward and Reverse**
