Welcome to my first `GRIT Blog` post.

**`[UPDATE]`**

`Team GRIT is now using Discord` as its chat and voice platform.

You can download Discord through the iPhone App Store.

Or, from your web browser go [here](https://discord.com/login)

Once in, join the `GRIT - Zwift group` using <https://discord.gg/jTqyBVK> <br><br>
  

**Tomorrow is the All American Bikes Ride presented by GRIT (B)**

Course is `Casse-Pattes` where you can see details [here](https://zwiftinsider.com/route/casse-pattes/)

The race profile looks like this:

The major focus of the morning (for some) will be the `Petit KOM`

A few GRIT members crushed it last week, and got well under `5:00`

A few others got close to `5:00` and/or got a PR well under `5:30`

Let's see how much the following table changes after tomorrow morning.

I took liberty to `highlight` a few names and times (don't worry, everyone will
at one point or another get the `highlight`)
