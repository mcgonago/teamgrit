GRIT is now on Discord, see detail [below](#discord).

Tomorrow is the [GRIT Group Ride - Mountain Route](https://zwiftpower.com/events.php?zid=1289864)

Course is the [Insbrucking KOM (after party)](https://zwiftinsider.com/route/kom-after-party)

A few of us will go for `sub 20:00`

KOM **[Tacx T2058.94 2018 World Championship Innsbruck - Main Climb](https://www.strava.com/segments/15830123 "you ready to go sub 20:00?")**

One could argue different KOM "levels" (Planet Fitness - Judgement Free Zone, I was very
careful with the 23:00)

````
1. Sub 23:00 is C level of KOM skill
2. Sub 22:00 is B level of KOM skill
3. Sub 20:00 is A level
4. Sub 19:00 is A++ level
````

Thoughts:

- If your PR is `already sub 20:00` - you are going for KOM of the day
- A few may go for **`sub 20:00 for first time`**
- For **`sub 20:00`** - word on the street - will take a 4.5wpg effort
- One recommendation - steady `stomp on the 6%+`, find a few `fast friends`
  on the few false flats, **`CRUSH the last 1 mile`**
- Last mile is somewhat **`tame`** - if you pace yourself well, find a few
  friends, and crush the last mile - sub 20:00 is in your grasp.

Here is todays `Team GRIT leaderboard up Innsbruck KOM`

Let's see if any of this changes after tomorrow.
