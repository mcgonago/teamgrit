**`Strava Segments Down`**

Hopefully **Strava** fixes it.

Can't see the **Col Du Zwift** segment which is usually found [**HERE**](https://www.strava.com/segments/11594001?filter=overall)

Can there be anything worse?

`**UPDATE**` We are all good to go

What just went down is described [**HERE**](https://zwiftinsider.com/verified-zwift-strava-segments/)

Don't worry, we still have our Petit, Volcano, Titan, Alpe, Ventoux, Petit (worth mentioning twice),
Box, Epic, Libby, 23rd, Yorkshire, Fox, Box, Leith, Bologna, Innsbruck.

I can sleep peacefully tonight.

Final results for this week?

Guess we live with **2** events, using results from [`**YESTERDAY**`](../../../2021/01/28/Thursday-throw-down.html)

**Congrats** to this weeks winners.
