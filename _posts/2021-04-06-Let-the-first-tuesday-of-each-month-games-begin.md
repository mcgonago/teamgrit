**How does this work?**

Based on your signup on Tuesday - you are in the A Group, or B Group

Miss Tuesday? Default to A.

**Tuesday** is All American Bike ride - this week, Richmond

We combine your **best Libby and 23rd effort**

**Thursday** Sprints!

We rank you based on best sprint

And finally, **Friday** monster climb up **Innsbruck**

Each day results will be posted on the **ZwiftPower** forum

**Enjoy**

**GRIT** has a few people coming off the disabled list.

**30% better than Bjarne** may only be 10% better at this time <br>
**McFartonator** will be stinking up things before you know it
