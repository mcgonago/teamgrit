Under the umbrella of `sharing a bit too much information...`

Way back, **early 2000s** I spent a little time writing a few things
down, saving some results, and posting to my old mcgonagle.ws
"somewhat of a blogging" website (defunct)

I have noticed, all this blogging, has improved my **vocabuleary** a slight bit.

Also, I give thanks to Mr. Timothy Gallwey and his book [Inner Game of Tennis](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Inner_Game_of_Tennis/zA3GvAlJvccC?hl=en&gbpv=1)

The **ego** went away after reading Tim's book - ego was **alive and well** in early 2000s.

The `Inner Game` is a good read.
