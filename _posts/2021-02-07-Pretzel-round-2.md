**`The good`**
- **MGCC** hosting another great ride
- **GRITers** lighting it up out there (again)
- `30% better than Bjarne`, and `Norseman` taking names
- `30% better than Bjarne` in the **sub 19 club**!!!

**`The bad`**
- `How can there be anything bad riding a bike?`

**`The ugly`**
- A full carb weekend
