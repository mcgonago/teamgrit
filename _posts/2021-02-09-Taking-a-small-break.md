Even though I have some nice words from Zwift - and I quote *"For as long as one's privacy is not
violated, you can go ahead with your idea"*

And, a few recent updates to our **Zwift Forum** Semi-official link:

[**Sharing results with friends**](https://forums.zwift.com/t/sharing-results-with-friends/534276/9 "Sharing with friends at Zwift forum")

There still is a very fine line with respect to anyone doing a
cut/paste of results - be it from Zwift and/or Strava - in terms of
athlete **privacy**

I have tried the reach out on **please send me your nicknames**, which
is great, but at end of day, does take away a bit of the **spice**
that goes into each of the **GRIT** rides - as far as *tracking,
communicating, categorizing, grouping, and providing yet another way
to enjoy the virutal world.*

If it is of interest to you, feel free to visit the link below, share
some of your thoughts, give a **vote**

**`Supposedly, the more a post gathers visits/votes, the more Zwift and
Co. will take a look.`**

FYI - here is a snippet of a recent reach out to Zwift - waiting to hear back:

**`From`**: Owen <br>
**`To`**: Zwift (and also Strava)

> **Do u give elevated privileges to anyone? I believe the way I can post,
track, and categorize my clubs GRIT rides would benefit Strava and its
riders (Zwift GRIT club rides)**
>
> **Do u have a “program” and/or way (suggestion) on how to go about this?**
>
> **I see other web sites that allow for reposting of athletes results -
how do they do that legally (due to privacy rules)? I would like to do
the same.**
>
> Thx in advance <br>
> Owen
