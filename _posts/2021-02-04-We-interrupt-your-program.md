**`A bit of good, and bad news.`**

**Bad** - GRIT point series needs to find a different home.

**Good** - I guess there is nothing good ;)

I am working with Zwift and/or Strava to find a different home.

I am sure something will be worked out.

In the meantime - keep joining our fun GRIT rides, enjoy the open
roads, and when things are figured out, the blogging will continue
where it had left off.

Once you lift yourself off the floor, always feel free to reach out to me at mcgonagleo@gmail.com

See you on the roads.

Later.
