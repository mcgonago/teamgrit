Entry #2 on `Petit KOM` smackdown

First smackdown is found [here](https://mcgonago.github.io/teamgrit/2020/12/01/A-Smack-down-on-Petit-KOM.html)

The GRIT [All American Bikes Ride](https://zwiftpower.com/events.php?zid=1314426) had **~150** riders showing up!

As always, an A group and B group:

- A group lead by `Rob Fullerton`, B by `John Jeffries` (JJ)
- As always, a stupendous leading job by both.

For reference, Zwift describes route `Casse-Pattes` [here](https://zwiftinsider.com/route/casse-pattes/)

The race profile looks like:

I am a bit bogged down a the moment (1:19 pm) - but just wanted a quick shout
out to the **`top XX`** that show up in the ZwiftPower `Primes` list.

I apologize if you did a faster first time up, then beat someone on the
list below - don't worry, you will see your **Name In Lights (NIL)** later on ...

We hit a **glitch** with quickly getting you the overal `Petit` results.

ZwiftPower unfortunately is **NOT** showing the `Petit` KOM results under
its `Sprints & KOMs` page (they sometimes do that)

So.....

- If/when results **NOT** showing up under `Sprints & KOMs`
- I take the most I can out of `Primes`
- Then, within a few minutes after ride, I do a pull down
  of the **Fastest times of the day** from **Strava**
- If you are not on Strava, but want your **Name In Lights (NIL)**
  I suggest getting on Strava and getting your results automatically
  uploaded (since I do a drop a few minutes after ride).
- I try to please everyone....
