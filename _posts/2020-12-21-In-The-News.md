Not much in the News this week.

`The Blog` is taking a few days off.

**No points race** series this week - holiday week.

We will be keeping tabs up the `Volcano` and `Tempo(ish) Sprints` and whatever
hill we decide to hit on Friday

**Coming soon** to a theatre near you?

Now that we have gone through **(3)** weeks of racing, time to take a small step
back, and giant leap forward.

The programming team at the `GRIT blog` headquarters is busy coorelating the data across all
3 + 4 + 3 race events, 10 in total, and determining how to break things up so that:

- Riders who have participated in at least (2) races/week get added to the
  **new** GRIT Team Points Race series.
- The `GRIT blog` programmers will take these riders, and evenly (to the
  best of their programming skill) add them to **TWO** teams.
- These teams will be announced at the end of this week.
- Next week - we will all do our GRIT duty - **KOM**, **Sprints**, and **Party/Hill**
- On a ranking scheme similar to Cross Country running - races will be given points from
  **(1)** to total.
- The **TEAM** with fewer points across all races is De'winner.

Benefits of this change?

- **TEAM** strength is determined by its **DEPTH**
- The **stronger** you ride, the **fewer** points you put on the board (i.e., points
  go from **1** to **{total-riders-in-event}**)

At some point we will make it so that races **Register** to race, instead of being automatically
added to the race results.

Enjoy, and see you on the roads soon.
