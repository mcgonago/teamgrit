`Back again`, Shady's back, tell a friend

Word from Zwift - and I quote *"For as long as one's privacy is not
violated, you can go ahead with your idea"*

Semi-official link is [**Sharing results with friends**](https://forums.zwift.com/t/sharing-results-with-friends/534276 "Sharing with friends at Zwift forum")

Will update blog if/when that changes.

Ok - **privacy** - what does that mean?

Could mean many things, but the top *2* would be:

1. If you want in, you opt in
2. If you opt in, send your nickname to <mcgonagleo@gmail.com>, put in subject 'nickname'
3. Results are posted to [*Zwift forum*](https://forums.zwift.com/ "Zwift Forum")
4. Results will not show up on any google search engines
5. Obviously, you need to register with [**Zwift forum**](https://forums.zwift.com/ "Zwift Forum") to see your name in lights.

Ok, that was *5*

Working as I type to get todays results pushed up.

Today was [*Grit - Mountain Route*](https://zwiftpower.com/events.php?zid=1652166 "link to ZwiftPower")
