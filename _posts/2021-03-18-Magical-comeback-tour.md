Another great day of **sprinting** this morning

**GRIT Point Series** back in action!

Instead of **GRIT point series** week-after-week-after-week - successfully
*burning us all out* - trying something new.

**First Tuesday** of each Month - kicks off a **GRIT point race** series week.

Again - using nicknames - some **official** (you sent it to me), some
**unofficial** - I randomly picked a nickname list from google, and pasted it in.

Please take no offense - I saw a **Porky Pig** in there, **Egghead**... it was random.

**REMEMBER** you need to participate in at least **2** of the Tue/Thu/Fri rides
to be eligible for entry into the **GRIT point series**.
