## What is GRIT?

GRIT stands for "Great rides for Intense Training"

There is a Club GRIT - a group of cyclists that ride on their
indoor trainers and train using the Zwift indoor training platform.

Each week GRIT sponsers 4-5 rides, and a brand new Run on Wednesday, where  
riders get to challenge themselves across a variety of cycling disciplines  
(hills, lap racing, sprints, ...) and against other riders - at, below, or above  
their current cycling fitness.  

### Rides

Each week GRIT runs a series of rides on the Zwift platform.

Typically:

````
Monday    - Grit Group Ride  
Tuesday   - All American Bikes Ride presented by GRIT  
Wednesday - Grit Group Ride - Mountain Route  
Wednesday - Grit Run
Thursday  - Tempo(ish) Thursday  
Friday    - Grit Group Ride - Partytime
