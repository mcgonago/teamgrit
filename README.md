## Who we are

GRIT stands for "Great rides for Intense Training"

GRIT was founded by Alan Brannan (year ?) and has grown to over
10 (?) members in 2020.

All rides are done on the Zwift indoor training platform.

Each week GRIT sponsers 4-5 rides, and a brand new Run on Wednesday, where  
riders get to challenge themselves across a variety of cycling disciplines  
(hills, lap racing, sprints, ...) and against other riders - at, below, or above  
their current cycling fitness.  

### Rides

Each week GRIT runs a series of rides on the Zwift platform.

Typically:

Monday    - Grit Group Ride  
Tuesday   - All American Bikes Ride presented by GRIT  
Wednesday - Grit Group Ride - Mountain Route  
Thursday  - Tempo(ish) Thursday  
Friday    - Grit Group Ride - Partytime
