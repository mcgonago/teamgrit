<br>
Hello all. It is that time of the year again where I get off my ass and start riding the bike, to get ready for
the up coming Sprint Triathlon Season!<br>
<br>
  Last year was a lot of fun - I finished the year stronger than I started, successfully executed Michael McCormack's training program
<a href="http://www.triathloncoach.com">(http:\\www.triathloncoach.com),</a> and made the
TimeoutProductions!
Vinny Testa's Awards banquet. The only races I concentrate on are the ones put on by Rich Havens at
TimeoutProductions! <a href="http://www.timeoutproductions.com">(http:\\www.timeoutproductions.com)</a>. There are (5) races to choose
from, and I typically always make the first Hyannis Sprint I in June, the Massachusetts Tri in Sharon in August, and the grand
finale Hyannis Sprint II in September.<br>
<br>
  A quick note on the TimeoutProductions! events - in the New England area there are two groups that put on the majority of triathlon
events. Fiske Independent Race Management (FIRM, <a href="http://www.firm-racing.com">http:\\www.firm-racing.com</a>) and
TimeoutProductions!. I have only
done a few of the FIRM events, but they never were as well organized, in comparison to
TimeoutProductions! events, they never
had enough volunteer help to make the events as safe, the after race food choices never matched up to
TimeoutProductions!, they have too
many events, thus losing the mystique similar to Hyannis Sprint (I,II), Sharon, and Falmouth, they put more emphasis on "team"
standings, after race award celebration is of a much poorer quality, and most of all, the level of competition, and number of
participants, is much, much, greater at the TimeoutProductions! events.<br>
<br>
Here it is, Monday, February 2, 2002, I am sitting at my terminal, typing away in Emacs shell mode, using M-x fill-nonuniform-paragraphs to
format the paragraph text, and
getting
ready for my first entry into my journey to 2002 Elite Triathlon Racing.<br>
<br>
  I am just recovering from a nasty Flu, and realize that once I am healthy again, it is time to get serious! Luckily, I got sick now,
instead of March/April, otherwise, I would have sat back and smelt the coffee a little too late.<br>
<br>
  The past (2) years I have concentrated on placing in the top (3) of the
TimeoutProductions! Point Rank Series. Take your top (3) race placings, add the points, and if you finish in the top (3) of your age group you
get invited to the annual Vinny Testa's awards banquet.
Last year I finished 2nd, the year before 1st, and it took the years 1997-1999 to
realize that I must swallow my ego, fake out the 1/4
mile swims, and concentrate more on the running and biking portions.<br>
<br>
  BUT not this year! NO! I have decided to race with the Elite/Pro. This does not mean that I will magically go faster than I have in
years past, all it will mean is that I will get to race neck-to-neck with the best
Triathletes in New England (and sometimes the nation)
and see if I can sneak in a few top placings. Is Vinny Testa's totally out of the realm of
possibilities? It all depends on who
shows up, how many Elite triathletes enter at least (3) TimeoutProductions! events, and who knows? I may just
sneak in
there.<br>
<br>
  I could make it a goal to finish in the top (3) of the Elite/Pro Point Rank Series. But, the realization is that Triathlons are
not my number (1) priority, and training at the level that some of these Elite Pro's train at would put too much stress on my
home life, professional life, and social life.<br>
<br>
  So, my goal for this season is to up the ante a little bit, buy that dream Trek Hilo (or equivalent) TT bike, get my 5-miler under 30:00,
get my TT (Concord individual time trial, <a href="http://www.northeastbicycleclub.org">http://www.northeastbicycleclub.org)
</a> under 22:00, and see how much faster I can go this year!<br>
<br>
  This past winter has been spent training under Fernado Braz and the Merrimack Valley Strider winter indoor track workouts
<a href="http://www.mvstriders.com">(http://www.mvstriders.com)</a>. Every Tuesday evening during Dec.,
Jan., Feb., and March, I do a track workout. My short term goal is to break 30:00 at the March 24, 2002, Charbo 5-miler. I have just
finished a few ~5-mile Fresh Ponders in 30:41, so I am not far off. Is dropping 41 seconds over the next (4) weeks possible?  Most
likely not, but the closer I get to 30:00, the closer I will be to one of my life long goals, to break 30:00 for a 5-miler, that will
at least put me past Bob the K'man Cahill's personal best!<br>

<br>
FIZZLED OUT...not much of a season...not that much fun racing<br>
with the big boys of Elite and getting your ass kicked.<br>
<br>
Kind of a lazy year in terms of tracking progress....<br>
<br>
But, here are a few articles I put together about Elite racing.<br>
<br>
Enjoy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Last race of the season:<br>
========================<br>
<br>
Here it is, just finished Hyannis II, last race of the season (for me,<br>
anyways), and I survived my first summer racing with the big boys of<br>
the Elite/Pro wave.<br>
<br>
Do I consider myself a "true" Elite competitor? Not sure? Time Out!<br>
Productions states that if an athlete anticipates a top-50 overall,<br>
they are invited to enter the Elite/Pro wave.<br>
<br>
What qualifies someone as a Elite competitor? For the first time, I<br>
found something actually written, describing the qualifications for<br>
competing in the Elite wave at the recent Monster Triathlon Challenge,<br>
Boston (http://www.monsterchallenge.org/eliteDivision.html).<br>
<br>
Basically, they state that if you can do an the Olympic Distance Race<br>
(1.5k S, 40k B, 10k R) in under 2:30:00, or a sprint distance (0.25 S,<br>
10 b, 3 r) under 1:03:00, you will most likely qualify. I say most<br>
likely, since it is still up to a review? By whom, not sure?<br>
<br>
Getting back to my experience racing Hyannis I, Falmouth Sprint,<br>
Massachusetts, and Hyannis II, here is why you should give it a shot.<br>
<br>
1. First, I would like to take back my "Cheat, Cheat, Sometimes Beat"<br>
   comments from my last entry. Why you ask? Since I came into the<br>
   transition with about (5) other people, and since I was in front of<br>
   them all out of the water, you could say that I was the cheat, but<br>
   we all know that is not true.<br>
<br>
2. If you have been to a Vinny Testa's awards banquet in the past, or,<br>
   if you have finished top 50 at a Time Out event, suck it up, and<br>
   race with the big boys and girls. Give some of the other age<br>
   groupers a chance.<br>
<br>
   For me, there is truth to the statement, misery loves company. I<br>
   finished 11/12, 10/11, 8/9, and 9/12, and it is not fair for Mike<br>
   Herlihy and I to always be bringing up the rear. Mike, get out on<br>
   the bike more often, and next year you will be kicking some serious<br>
   ass.<br>
<br>
3. You owe it to yourself to race on the open road. To know where you<br>
   stand at all times, to know just how fast other people can go, to<br>
   mingle with the best of the best, and bring yourself to a new level<br>
   of competition.<br>
<br>
   Believe me, for the next nine months I will be running from my bed<br>
   to breakfast table, from breakfast to my car, from my car to my<br>
   office chair, from the office chair to the head, and in reverse<br>
   order on the way home. Basically, I am sick and tired of getting<br>
   passed by people on the run - this message especially goes out to<br>
   Time Snow and Mike Davis - next year I will go faster on the swim<br>
   and bike, and with a faster run, I will be hanging out at the<br>
   finish line, drinking a Gatorade, with two more in my hands,<br>
   waiting to hand them to you when you get to the table. How sweet<br>
   would that be?<br>
<br>
4. If you are a swimmer (college), and only plan on doing sprints,<br>
   STOP SWIMMING! In the open ocean, with a wet suit, you can fake the<br>
   swim. Most likely, you are a fish out of water, and each second you<br>
   spend in the pool, you should be on the open road running!<br>
<br>
   For me, I swim 3,000 yrds/week (or make that 3,000 yrds/month),<br>
   only to keep a feel for the water, just enough, so that I can drag<br>
   off George Bent, and at times, when I feel like it, beat him out of<br>
   the water.<br>
<br>
   Hook up with some master swimmers, and join them in one of their<br>
   weekly pond swims.<br>
<br>
   I was a little curious, in the (3) races George did, how many<br>
   people can say they beat George at anything? George is a machine.<br>
<br>
   Hyannis I: Me - swim Steve Korbly - swim Paul Miller - run<br>
   Krzysztof Fidkowski - run<br>
<br>
   Falmouth: Carl Wittig - swim Kim Uldant - bike, run Patrick Dwyer -<br>
   run<br>
<br>
   Hyannis II: Rob Sczupak - swim Bill Gallagher - swim Tim Snow - run<br>
<br>
<br>
5. Buy a new bike. If you have thought about this more than (3) times,<br>
   you owe it to yourself to invest in some new machinery, that will<br>
   not only make you go faster, but it will give you more incentive to<br>
   work on the bike portion.<br>
<br>
   For me, I bought a brand new Cervelo P2K, and I love it! Not to get<br>
   a ding in, but check out www.fitwerx.com.<br>
<br>
   Find a local time trial (TT) to train with during the summer. There<br>
   is a good one in Concord on Thursday evenings. There is no better<br>
   way to improve your cycling, other than getting a USCF (United<br>
   States Cycling Federation) license and doing a few USCF races.<br>
<br>
6. Thats it for now. I am bummed that I will missing the Vinny Testa's<br>
   banquet this coming March. But, I plan on coming back next summer<br>
   with a vegeance.<br>
<br>
   Train hard and eat less!<br>
