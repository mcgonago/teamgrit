Control<br>
Drift &amp; Die<br>
Out Of My Head<br>
Nobody Told Me<br>
Blurry<br>
She Hates Me<br>
Bring Me Down<br>
Never Change<br>
Basement<br>
Said<br>
Piss It All Away<br>
<br>
"Control"<br>
<br>
I love the way you look at me<br>
I feel the pain you place inside<br>
lock me up inside ya dirty cage<br>
while I'm alone inside my mind<br>
<br>
I like to teach you all the rules<br>
I'd get to see them set in stone<br>
I like it when you chain me to the bed<br>
there ya secrets never shone<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I need to feel you<br>
You need to feel me<br>
I can't control you<br>
You're not the one for me, no<br>
<br>
I can't control you<br>
You can't control me<br>
I need to feel you<br>
So why's it involve<br>
<br>
I love the way you rape my skin<br>
I feel the hate you place inside<br>
I need to get your voice out of my head<br>
Cause I'm the guy you'll never find<br>
<br>
I'm faking all of the rules<br>
there's no expressions on your face<br>
I'm hoping some day you will let me go<br>
Release me from my dirty cage<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I need to feel you<br>
You need to feel me<br>
I can't control you<br>
You're not the one for me, no<br>
<br>
I can't control you<br>
You can't control me<br>
I need to feel you<br>
So why's it involve...you and me..<br>
<br>
[Repeat 4x]<br>
I love the way you look at me<br>
I love the way you smack my ass<br>
I love the dirty things you do<br>
I have control of you<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I need to feel you<br>
You need to feel me<br>
I can't control you<br>
You're not the one for me, no<br>
<br>
I can't control you<br>
You can't control me<br>
I need to feel you<br>
So why's it involve you and me..<br>
<br>
[Repeat 4x]<br>
You're not the one for me, no<br>
<br>
"Drift &amp; Die"<br>
<br>
Forgotten thoughts of yesterday<br>
through my eyes I see the past<br>
<br>
Well I don't know I don't know I don't know why<br>
I Believe I Believe I Believe in the truth, from inside<br>
go away go away go away from me<br>
leave me alone<br>
ignorance spreads lies<br>
how much will money bye<br>
Well I'll take my time as I drift and die<br>
<br>
Unwanted live my life a shame<br>
Who's to blame for my mistakes<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
as I drift and die [x2]<br>
<br>
ignorance spreads lies<br>
how much will money bye<br>
Well I'll take my time&nbsp;<br>
As I drift and die [x5]<br>
<br>
"Out Of My Head"<br>
<br>
what is wrong with all my friends<br>
I know that I am unlike them<br>
just another situation<br>
don't hold me back<br>
I don't look good to them<br>
<br>
They always act so dirty<br>
they keep themselves so clean<br>
why can't they find the answers<br>
to the questions that are right in front of me<br>
I'm so high, I'm never low<br>
I'll hold the sky, never letting go<br>
<br>
Let it go<br>
no ones ever listening<br>
the lines are crossed somewhere between<br>
my head is spinning like a top<br>
I don't know when this shit is going to stop<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
you fill my cup, I'm good to go<br>
so shake me up<br>
go...go...go...<br>
<br>
I'm so high, I'm never low<br>
I'll hold the sky, and I'm never letting go&nbsp;<br>
go...go...go...<br>
<br>
"Nobody Told Me"<br>
<br>
Looking back in my childhood<br>
wasn't to bad but it wasn't that great<br>
I carried the luggage like a bag of bricks<br>
feels like it's holding me down again<br>
starring down a pitch black road<br>
painted lines show me the direction<br>
sun is burning on my face<br>
sun is setting me on fire<br>
<br>
Nobody told me where to go<br>
Nobody told me where to run<br>
<br>
I can't find my way back home<br>
lost my head down there some where<br>
could we just be gone alone<br>
lived in doubt of fear i've shown<br>
gazing down a long gray road<br>
I see the stop sign way ahead<br>
the sun is burning on my face<br>
the sun is setting me on fire<br>
<br>
Nobody told me where to go<br>
Nobody told me where to run<br>
Nobody told me where to go<br>
Nobody told me where to run<br>
Nobody told me, Nobody told me<br>
<br>
Same old shit different day<br>
gotta get up, gotta get up<br>
[x5]<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
"Blurry"<br>
<br>
Everything's so blurry<br>
and everyone's so fake<br>
and everybody's empty<br>
and everything is so messed up<br>
pre-occupied without you<br>
I cannot live at all<br>
My whole world surrounds you&nbsp;<br>
I stumble then I crawl<br>
<br>
You could be my someone<br>
you could be my sea<br>
you know that i'll protect you<br>
from all of the obscene<br>
I wonder what you're doing<br>
imagine where you are<br>
there's oceans in between us<br>
but that's not very far<br>
<br>
Can you take it all away<br>
can you take it all away<br>
well ya shoved it in my face<br>
this pain you gave to me<br>
Can you take it all away<br>
can you take it all away<br>
well ya shoved it my face<br>
<br>
Everyone is changing<br>
there's noone left that's real<br>
to make up your own ending<br>
and let me know just how you feel<br>
cause I am lost without you<br>
I cannot live at all<br>
my whole world surrounds you<br>
I stumble then I crawl<br>
<br>
You could be my someone<br>
you could be my sea<br>
you know that i will save you<br>
from all of the unclean<br>
I wonder what you're doing<br>
I wonder where you are<br>
There's oceans in between us<br>
but that's not very far<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Nobody told me what you thought<br>
nobody told me what to say<br>
everyone showed you where to turn<br>
told you when to runaway<br>
nobody told you where to hide<br>
nobody told you what to say<br>
everyone showed you where to turn<br>
showed you when to runaway<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
This pain you gave to me<br>
<br>
You take it all<br>
You take it all away...<br>
This pain you gave to me<br>
You take it all away<br>
This pain you gave to me<br>
Take it all away<br>
This pain you gave to me<br>
<br>
"She Hates Me"<br>
<br>
Met a girl, thought she was grand<br>
fell in love, found out first hand<br>
went well for a week or two<br>
then it all came unglued<br>
<br>
in a trapp trip I can't grip<br>
never thought I'd be the one who'd slip<br>
then I started to realize<br>
I was living one big lie<br>
<br>
She fucking hates me<br>
trust<br>
she fucking hates me<br>
la la la love<br>
I tried too hard<br>
and she tore my feelings like I had none<br>
and ripped them away<br>
<br>
She was queen for about an hour<br>
after that shit got sour<br>
she took all I ever had<br>
no sign of guilt<br>
no feeling of bad, no<br>
<br>
In a trapped trip I can't grip&nbsp;<br>
never thought i'd be the one who'd slip<br>
then I started to realize<br>
I was living one big lie<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
that's my story, as you see<br>
learned my lesson and so did she<br>
now it's over and i'm glad&nbsp;<br>
'cause i'm a fool for all i've said<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
la la la la la la la la la love<br>
Trust<br>
la la la la la la la la la love<br>
Trust<br>
and she tore my feelings like I had none<br>
she fucking hates me<br>
<br>
"Bring Me Down"<br>
<br>
Make no promises to me<br>
your slowly melting<br>
wake up then fall back asleep<br>
your quickly fading<br>
hey man you'll have to wait your turn<br>
i can see that your joneisn<br>
taste no flavors on my tongue<br>
they've evaporated, you've disintegrated<br>
<br>
Why you gotta bring me down<br>
why you gotta bring me&nbsp;<br>
bring me down<br>
<br>
Karma comes aroudn two times<br>
so you better be good<br>
watch out for all fimiliar signs<br>
when your going the wrong way<br>
look back into those devious minds<br>
they keep pushing and pulling<br>
baby Jesus never sleeps<br>
when your being a sinner<br>
yeah he'll eat you for dinner<br>
<br>
Why you gotta bring me down<br>
<br>
Make no promises to me<br>
your slowly melting<br>
baby Jesus never sleeps<br>
when your being a sinner<br>
hey man you'll have to wait your turn<br>
I can see that your jonesin<br>
taste no flavors on my tongue<br>
they've evaporated,you've disintegrated<br>
<br>
Why you gotta bring me down...<br>
<br>
"Never Change"<br>
<br>
Someone's always tellin me i'm no good<br>
well I don't care what you say<br>
someone's always giving me a hard time<br>
well I live day to day<br>
someone's always puttin me in my place<br>
like I don't know where I am<br>
so I'll just sit here in the corner<br>
without any direction<br>
<br>
Maybe it's all in my head<br>
i think that it's something something you said<br>
I understand that somethings will never change never change&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Someone's always kickin me to the curb<br>
well it's grindin off my face<br>
someone's always pushin me to the side<br>
like I'm standing in the way<br>
someone's always gettin up my face<br>
like I don't know who I am<br>
to old to get um in the corner<br>
without any direction<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Somebody's always out to get me<br>
somebody's always tryin to kill me<br>
understand somethings will never change<br>
couldn't you have just stayed the same<br>
why did you have to go and say<br>
understand somethings don't change<br>
<br>
Why did you have to go and change<br>
couldn't you have just stayed the same<br>
why did you have to go and say<br>
understand somethings don't change<br>
<br>
Never change<br>
somethings never change<br>
somethings never change<br>
<br>
"Basement"<br>
<br>
Yeah<br>
locked in the basement<br>
I'm so paranoid i'm all incased and I can't escape<br>
and when I look up, mothers looking down<br>
and when I wake up, mothers not around<br>
<br>
Cause if you want you can have<br>
everything that I've got<br>
cause if you want&nbsp;<br>
you can take it all away from me<br>
away from me [x2]<br>
<br>
Nobodies perfect, but you just can't see<br>
my life's a circus that you don't believe<br>
your sayin something but not coming clean<br>
now when I wake up mothers livin she's livin in her dreams<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Cause if your satisfied well I'll watch you wave goodbye<br>
cause if you want you can take it all away from me<br>
<br>
Please don't come down and see me this way<br>
please don't come down, I'm to afraid<br>
please don't come down and see me this way<br>
please don't come down well i'm to afraid<br>
<br>
[Chorus (x2)]<br>
<br>
cause if your unsatisfied well I'll watch you wave goodbye<br>
cause if you want you can take it all away from me...<br>
<br>
"Said"<br>
<br>
Emotionless I slip in to the black<br>
and there's no turning back now<br>
everyone around me smoking crack<br>
this tunnel is blinding<br>
hallucinating I'm debating life&nbsp;<br>
but it's still moving forward<br>
if I could change the hands of time<br>
<br>
Well I'd do it better<br>
<br>
Just walk away<br>
just walk away<br>
just walk away<br>
<br>
fearless I have fell in to a trap<br>
and there's no way around it<br>
everyone is crying in the back<br>
my kin is around me<br>
hesistating there's no second chance<br>
when you know your a loser<br>
keep on trying keep an open mind<br>
<br>
I'm caught in a circle<br>
<br>
Just walk away [x3]<br>
<br>
Emotionless I slip in to the crack<br>
fill as if I've fell in to the blue<br>
hullucinating there's no turning back<br>
everyone around me smoking crack<br>
<br>
Just walk away [x4]<br>
<br>
If you even heard a thing I've said<br>
<br>
"Piss It All Away"<br>
<br>
What I feel it is real<br>
what I do it's the truth<br>
when I drink I can't think<br>
when I use I need more<br>
when you're weak I can't speak<br>
close your eyes and taste this wine<br>
the cork removed less purified<br>
I throw everything away that you say<br>
erase everything that you fake<br>
what I feel it's a sin<br>
tell the truth do not lie<br>
make a wish it will come true<br>
one way streets one track mind<br>
open up and see the light<br>
one million ways to hypnotize<br>
I throw everything away that you say<br>
erase everything that you fake<br>
erase everything that you fake<br>
<br>
piss it piss it all away [x7]<br>
<br>
piss it piss it<br>
