Today is, Wednesday, June 25th, 2003

Sitting here typing up what to do over the next couple of months.

Somehow mustered up enought drive to kick myself in the
ass and over a two month period (April 8, 2003 - June 14, 2003) go
from not having run or biked since September, up in the 165+
lb. category, to:
         
  &gt; 1.  Getting in a few 9+ hours of riding.
  &gt; 2.  Attempt a CCB Wedn. group ride (got dropped at the 20 mi. mark,
  &gt;     had to ride the last 20 mi. alone and miserable).
  &gt; 3.  Fit in a 3+ hour single morning ride before work.
  &gt; 4.  Maintain a 1/week 15 minutes of weight training.
  &gt; 5.  Try to get 1/week swim session.
  &gt; 6.  Faithfully maintain some sort of daily stretch routine - to help
  &gt;     the back out.
  &gt; 7.  Gradually build up the # hours/week or running (up to 30 min./week
  &gt;     right now, WOW!).
  &gt; 8.  Go see Dr. Dave to fix the lower back (it is almost there).
  &gt; 9.  Drop weight from 165+ to around 154.
  &gt; 10. Yearly group ride with the KMan.
  &gt; 11. Show up at Hyannis I and do my best - 40th overall, 10th in age
  &gt;     group, off of 3+ miles/week running.
         
After the Hyannis I race, went to the Brownies cabin for a vacation.
Had lots of fun, though the weather could have been better, caught a
cold, went back to work, and here it is now, Wednesday, 1.5 weeks
after the race, and just starting to get over the cold/flu/strep that
I caught...
         
Basically, took almost (2) weeks off after Hyannis I. Ate a lot,
rested a lot, hung out with family a lot, now time to get back in the
groove.  
                                                  
Next race is Massachusetts Triathlon, Sharon MA, on Sunday,
August 17th.

RACE DAY                                                     RACE DAY

That leaves a good (7) weeks to get ready for the next race!
                    
Last time, the idea was to concentrate somewhat on getting the weight
from 165+ to 154, which was accomplished through training and watching
the diet.

This time though, lets say today I am at 157+. Instead of trying to
drop (1) lb/week, to get down to a 150 lb. fighting weight, why not
concentrate on running an extra 30 minutes / week from now until
race week.

Lets assume an (8) minute/mile pace. 1 hr. gives roughly (8) miles
of running. If we can get to (3.5) hours, we would be at 30+ miles/week,
which would surely give me the running base to at least hold the lead
after the bike (bike will still max out at 9+ hours/week, maybe more).

So, time to concentrate on the RUN, which will automatically translate
to lower lbs.

Also, time to start counting calories and watching what I eat. Need
to create the &quot;nutrition hall of fame&quot; and start storing away foods
that I would have eaten, but instead attach a &quot;sub 20&quot; sticker to them
and store away!

Whats up?

Been a while...

Training going pretty well. Done a few Concord TT's (23:50, 24+ mph,
best time of 22:49 done (2) years back), some awesome 50+, 2.5+ hr,
Tuesday morning hammer sessions with Bob Cahill (KMan).

Finally recovered from a nasty cold, weight getting down there (152),
a little break here and there, running only on the treadmill - thanks
to Chris Hafferty's suggestion/training-program - and ready to kick
some sorry ass on Sunday, August 17th, at the timeoutproductions.com
Massachusetts triathlon.

Making a long story short, after my 10th place/age-group finish at the
Hyannis Sprint I triathlon, it is a long shot for me to finish top (3)
in my age group and get an invite to the Vinney Testa's awards dinner.

Here is my competition:

Falmouth:                  Fairlee:              Hyannis I:
==============             ==================    ==============
NOIEL FONTAINE             TIM DOWNES            MARK HECOX      
PAUL WESSEL                JULIAN BAYUK          NOIEL FONTAINE  
GREGORY HAMILTON           TED PHILIP            PAUL WESSEL     
MARK HECOX                 TODD CHRISTY          TODD CHRISTY

JOE EMMENDORFER            STEVE LONG            GAVIN DOWELL    
GEORGE DOHERTY             BRETT BATCHELDER      DAVID VOSE      
ED DONOVAN                 BRIAN KEARNEY         RICKY COYNE     
OWEN MCGONAGLE             CHRISTOPHER KOUNIOTIS DAVID GAMBLE    
                           PAUL DEBITETTO        SEAN LAWLESS    
                           KEITH JORDAN          AA HOPEMAN      
                           ROBERT DAVIS          JOSEPH BINETTE  
                                                 ROBERT DAVIS    
                                                 GEORGE DOHERTY  
                                                                
To sneak in there, I need to win Sharon and Hyannis II:
 
Mark    1, 4
Noiel   1, 2
Wessel  2, 3
Todd    6, 4, 4
Julian  5, 2,
.
.
.
Me     10, 1, 1      &lt;====== this is the ONLY way, can't catch Mark or
                             Noiel, but Wessel is within reach.

Training has been going well enough, that with a good race at Sharon,
and the boost in confidence after winning Sharon, I should be able to
kick some serious ass at Hyannis II.

Everything boils down to how fast I go at Sharon. I need to win Sharon
and carry that over to a win at Hyannis II.

How to get there?

1.  Rest/taper properly for Sharon.
2.  Follow strict nutrition plan to get under 150 for Sharon, and
    mid/high 140's for Hyannis II.
3.  Get under 4:00 for the Eastern Ave. hill.
4.  Sneak in a Kanc ride?
5.  Sneak in a CCB ride?
6.  Break 23:00 at Concord TT.
7.  Follow coach Chris Hafferty's treadmill running.
8.  Get in some &quot;feel&quot; good swims (don't lose feel of water).
9.  Beat the KMan on the first hill!
10. A few more Tuesday hammer sessions with the KMan.
11. If possible, fit in a training race somewhere?
12. If possible, try a Fresh Pond 2.5 miler and see where I am at.
13. DON'T BURN OUT - go back and use as much of MM^2 stationary
    program as possible.
14. Race smart
15. Train smart.

If I do most/all of these, there is no reason why I can't finish high
enough in my age group to crack the top (3) in the points series...
